# Practical Machine Learning Assignment
Loading The required Library Files.
```{r results = 'hold'}
library(caret)
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)
library(randomForest)
```

Loading the Data from the Training Matrix. The dimension is as shown below:
```{r , }
training <- read.csv('pml-training.csv',header=T)
print(dim(training))
```

As the data contains many fields with NA and "", which may not be useful as features while building a predictor, Its important that we get rid of those noises to get a more clean set of data. Below code removes the unnecessary Fields.
Dimension after Cleaning the data is as shown :

```{r}
clean_data <- training[,colSums(is.na(training)) == 0]
clean_data <- clean_data[,colSums(clean_data=="")== 0]
d = dim(clean_data)
```



```{r}
```

```{r}
```
